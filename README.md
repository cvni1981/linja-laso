# linja laso
(laso pi mute ante li pali e linja ni e lipu ni)
### current version: 0.3
![specimen of v0.2](specimens/0.3.png)

this is a little font i'm making, based on a grid and with sharp edges! More about [how](https://github.com/cvni1981/linja-laso/wiki). (under construction!)

any and all quibbles may be sent to cvni1981@gmail.com

### currently has:
- nimi pu ale, nimi ku suli ale
    - also the nimi ku lili in the UCSUR standard so all glyphs are included
    - also vast majority of alts `tonsi1 tonsi2...`
- cartouched glyphs `[ ]`, morae dots `. (period); · (interpunct) :`and tick marks `,`, te and to quotation marks
- stackable versions of most glyphs `-`
- directional ni `ni>v ⇒ ↘; ni: ⇒ →`
- zero width non joiner/ZWNJ `|`

### will (hopefully soon) have:
- personal glyphs (priority on those who Need them to be identified)
- more stack glyphs?
    - including special ones as character variants, like kama pona, kama sona, toki pona
- make the letters not look too crappy
- toki pona radicals
- scaling glyphs (same thing, if they dont look too bad when squished)
- proportional (non-monospaced) version!
- half thickness version!
